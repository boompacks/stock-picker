# stock-picker
Stock Picker project from The Odin Project:

Implement a method #stock_picker that takes in an array of stock prices, one for each hypothetical day. It should return a pair of days representing the best day to buy and the best day to sell. Days start at 0. The user must first buy before he can sell
